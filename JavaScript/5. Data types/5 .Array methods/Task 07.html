  <body>
    You have an array of user objects, each one has user.name. Write the code
    that converts it into an array of names. For instance:
    <script>
      let john = { name: "John", age: 25 };
      let pete = { name: "Pete", age: 30 };
      let mary = { name: "Mary", age: 28 };

      let users = [john, pete, mary];

      /* ... your code */
      let names = users.map((item) => item.name);

      alert(names); // John, Pete, Mary
    </script>
  </body>
