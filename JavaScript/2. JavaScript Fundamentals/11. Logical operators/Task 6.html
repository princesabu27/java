    Write an if condition to check that age is NOT between 14 and 90
    inclusively. Create two variants: the first one using NOT !, the second one
    â€“ without it.

    <script>
      let age = prompt("Enter age");

      if (age <= 14 && age >= 90) {
        alert("you are outside");
      } else {
        alert("You are inside");
      }

      // Second method

      if (!(age = 14 && age <= 90)) {
        alert("You are outside the age limit");
      } else {
        alert("You are inside the age limit");
      }
    </script>
